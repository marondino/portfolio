                <p>Time wasn't on our side. Soon we would have a Hackathon and our stakeholders were anxious about having something to test. We spend a few days talking with game developers, and we dived into their daily tasks and minds to find a clue that would direct us to the right path.</p></div>

                            <p>The first thing I did was to map all the steps of the game developer within the game creation process, considering the variations of paths and patterns when creating, managing and editing a game.</p></div>

                            <p>Since there's no perfect receipt for game creation, it was pretty hard for us to find a connection between all steps our games went through in the game creation process. Through a brainstorming, we were able to connect the dots and find what are the most relevant features for each type of game and things that were interesting for all kinds of games.</p>

                            <p>Remember I mentioned that most of game developers didn't knew all types of features that were available within Wildlife Studios? Yeah, that was another thing we took a look at. For that, I decided to create a "Wiki” for all game features and its’ documentation, so that everyone could find things easily when needed.<br>Through our news emails, we also started to promote those features and ask our game developers to try it whenever they can.</p>

                            <p>I also created a CLI Design documentation, that aimed to help devs involved on this project to know exactly how things should behave, what kind of voice tone we should use, and what colors the CLI should display on each command.</p>

                    <div class="conclusion-text">This project required me to understand the developers daily tasks, the challenges they face everyday and how things work behind the scenes. By learning about all those things, I was able to have a straight and clear communication with them. We became closer!
                        By building the documentation and our 'Wiki’, I was able to get a bigger view of what devs are talking about and how we, as designers, could help them.
                        And the most important thing: the team learned that there's no right and wrong when it's about game creation process. Each team has it's own way to build and evolve games, but this was an opportunity for us as company, to find standards and turn it into something scalable by automating things and decrease bureaucracy.
                        We were able to finish the CLI in time, and test on our Hackathon. There were things to be fixed, of course, but the feedback we got from our users were promising: They got really exited about automating boring tasks and things that usually take a lot of their time.
