                <p>I was born and raised in a country side town, dreaming big about what I wanted to be. My mon is an artist, my dad is a developer and entrepreneur. My family was always there to encourage me to be what I wanted to be, and never loose my essence.</p>
                <p>If ask me to choose a word to define myself, I would choose Dreamer. This is something that I can tell, I'm really got at dreaming. But life thought me that dreaming is not enough, so since I was a little kid I've been learning about how to plan and map risks so that I can make my dreams come true.</p>

                <div class="m-title2">You might be asking yourself: Why is she using an old photo of herself?</div>
                <p>Being an adult is not easy as I thought when I used to be a child. There's a lot of pressure, expectations and bills to pay.</p>
                <p>The reason I'm using this old photo is a friendly reminder for you and myself, that growing up does not mean losing our inner child. To be happy and survive, we must remain curious, fearless, with no prejudices, just thinking about that unfinished puzzle.</p>
                <p>I'm a problem solver, and when I'm at work I remember a lot about me when I was a little kid, creative and imaginative, just like my kids.</p>
